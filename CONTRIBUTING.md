# Contributing to PostgreSQL Advanced Backup & Restore Tool

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving documentation.

## ü§ù How to Contribute

### 1. Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/postgres-backup-tool.git
   cd postgres-backup-tool
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
   ```

### 2. Development Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Bash 4.0+
- PostgreSQL client tools (`psql`, `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`)
- Git
- A text editor or IDE

**Test Environment Setup:**
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL client tools (if not already installed)
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install postgresql-client

# Arch Linux  
sudo pacman -S postgresql

# macOS
brew install postgresql
```

### 3. Making Changes

**Code Style Guidelines:**
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing naming conventions

**Function Naming:**
- Use lowercase with underscores: `function_name()`
- Use descriptive names: `monitor_backup_progress()` not `progress()`
- Prefix utility functions with their purpose: `print_color()`, `log()`

**Variable Naming:**
- Use uppercase for constants: `readonly CONFIG_FILE="..."`
- Use lowercase for local variables: `local backup_file="..."`
- Use descriptive names: `estimated_size` not `size`

**Error Handling:**
- Always check command exit codes
- Use meaningful error messages
- Include cleanup procedures for failed operations
- Log errors with timestamps

### 4. Testing Your Changes

**Manual Testing:**
```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x postgres-backup-restore.sh

# Test the interactive menu
./postgres-backup-restore.sh

# Test specific functions (if you added command-line options)
./postgres-backup-restore.sh --test-connections
```
